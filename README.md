// Jason Loa 11/18/25, I added a blackjack game into the code
// A random card will be dealt to both the "dealer" and "player", and the player can choose to hit or stand based on the value of their hand. Whichever side gains a value over 21 loses, and the other wins. If both are under value 21, then the one with the higher hand wins.
// Both hands used Linked List, and those are called when cards are added to the hands, when the hands are displayed, and when the values are calculated.
// To play, run the program, and the program will give you a value and the dealer's value, and you can decide to hit or stand. Stand, it will calculate who has the higher total. Once one game is over, the program can ask if youd want to replay.
